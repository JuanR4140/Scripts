FIREWALL

Status: ON
Incoming: REJECT
Outgoing: ALLOW

MALWARE
--------

sudo apt install clamav / clamscan
clamscan
    - Use clamscan to check for malware in system


PORTS
-----

If you know a specific port in which a malicious process listens on,
`fuser [port]/tcp`
can be used to find which PID it has.

This can be useful to find further information on where the malware resides.

Additionally,
`netstat -tulnap`
shows all ports being used on the system, as well as the names of the programs
that are using them. (CAn be used with fuser)

USERS
-----
Check users in system against users in README

if a user in the system is not root (and it should be)
    make it root

if a user in the system is root (and it should not be)
    remove root

if a user in the system has a weak password
    strengthen the password

if a user in the system has no password at all
    add strong password

if a user in the system isn't a root or user in README
    remove the user

GROUPS
------
cat /etc/group
    - lists all groups
addgroup [groupname]
    - adds group
adduser [user] [group]
    - adds user to group

PROGRAM UPDATES
---------------
Update programs such as:
    Firefox
        - Enable security/privacy settings
        - DELETE cookies and site dada when Firefox is closed

PAM FILES
---------
sudo apt install libpam-cracklib
    - Allows to put better password policies

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
    - Enforce password history of 5
        - Add "remember=5" to the end of the line that has "pam_unix.so" in it.

    - Enforce password length of 8:
        - Add "minlen=8" to the end of the line that has "pam_unix.so" in it

    - Enforce password complexity with one of each type of character:*
        - Add "ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1" to the end of the
        line with "pam_cracklib.so" in it.*

            *ucredit = upper case, lcredit = lower case, dcredit = number and ocredit = symbol
            ** cracklib may need to be installed before enforcing password complexity (see start of PAM FILES)
    - Save and close

gedit /etc/login.defs (or sudo nano)
    - Use CTRL + F to find section "PASS_MAX_AGE"
        - PASS_MAX_AGE should be 90
        - PASS_MIN_DAYS should be 10
        - PASS_WARN_AGE should be 7
    - Save and close

gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth (or sudo nano)
    - Add "auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=1800" to end of file
        - deny=5 -> Sets the number of allowed failed login attempts
        - unlock_time=1800 -> Sets the account lockout duration in seconds (1800 seconds -> 30 minutes)
    - Save and close

MEDIA FILES AND HIDDEN FILES
----------------------------

ls -la
    - Shows hidden folders

NOTE: CYBERPATRIOT USES HIDDEN FOLDERS TO HIDE MEDIA FILES

locate *.mp3 (or other extension)
    - Locates all files with extension
    - USE AT ROOT DIRECTORY TO RECURSIVELY SEARCH

SUSPICIOUS FILES
----------------
Look for installed programs
    REMOVE PROGRAMS LIKE
        - nmap
        - metasploit
        - armitage
        - aircrack-ng
        - bird sweep (suite)
        - offe crack
        - wireshark

PASSWORD AND SHADOW PERMISSIONS
--------------------------------
check pass.wd file and shadow file isn't allowed by guest user or standard users

Get rid of guest account
    The guest account is controlled by LightDM
    edit the LightDM file
    sudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (or sudo nano)
        NOTE: THE FILE MAY HAVE CHANGED FROM /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf TO /etc/lightdm/users.conf
        - add the line "allow-guest=false" to the end of the Light DM file
        - Save and close
        - Restart system and confirm guest account is disabled (click username button on top-right corner)

chmod [u,g or o][+ or -][r,w or x] [filepath]
    - Change permissions for user, group, or others
    - + or - to indicate adding or removing permissions
    - r for read, w for write, x for execute
    - filepath for filepath

SYSTEM LOGS
-----------
auth.log

dpkg.log
    - Tracks software events (installation and updates)
syslog
    - Tracks operating system events (error messages)
Xorg.0.log
    - Tracks desktop events (service changes and graphics card errors)

    - auditctl -e 1
    - view and modify policies with:
        - gedit /etc/audit/auditd.conf (or sudo nano)
